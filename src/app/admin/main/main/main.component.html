                The featured-app application is an application that allows you to log in as an admin using the data
                attached
                when downloading to add, modify or delete some tasks for users. It also allows you to follow up on these
                tasks
                when they are completed by the users.
                It also allows you to register via a new email and log in as a user to receive tasks from the admin and
                complete
                them only on the login page. Choose to log in as a user.
